It's literally at an all time high. Another point that seems politically driven - If you are criticising the economic recovery of phase 1 based on the fact that it is all due to Govt exp and not a consumption rise here's 3 points for you: 1. Same trend globally. Every govt is spending to revive the economy. Weren't you advocating a no holds barred currency printing last year yourself? There's no way pvt consumption - that was falling in India even pre covid btw - could have revived last year. 2. This is natural during any economic jolt. What  happened in 2009-2011? Are you claiming Congress govt revived pvt consumption when we saw those double digit growth figures? We all know the subsequent inflationary trends that lasted till 2013. It was all govt spending. 3. Growth is a factor of C+I+G+NX If we open up, we risk more dead people and eventually C will fall either way. Investment is actually growing. FDI is nearly at all time highs. You cannot expect exports to grow exponentially given the global problem. That leaves govt expenditure\"]"
